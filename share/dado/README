Libraries descriptions
========= ============

table/extra.lua

Some table manipulation functions used by the other libraries.

dado/sql.lua

The SQL statements composing library offers a collection of functions which
helps the creation of the most commonly used database operations.

dado.lua

Dado is a set of facilities implemented over LuaSQL connection objects.
It provides an iterator for selects, connection cache,
better database error messages and a uniform use for both insert and update.

dado/object.lua

The Object library offers basic functionality to create objects
associated with database rows.  These objects use a mechanism to retrieve
attributes automatically from the database.  The library also offers a class
constructor function to ease the creation of classes of database objects.
